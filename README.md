This repository contains the official implementation and dataset of the CVPR2024 paper "UVEB: A Large-scale Benchmark and Baseline Towards Real-World
Underwater Video Enhancement"


> Learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE)
methods have made great progress. However, the lack of
large-scale and high-quality paired training samples has
become the main bottleneck hindering the development of
UIE. The inter-frame information in underwater videos can
accelerate or optimize the UIE process. Thus, we constructed the first large-scale high-resolution underwater
video enhancement benchmark (UVEB) to promote the development of underwater vision. It contains 1,308 pairs
of video sequences and more than 453,000 high-resolution
with 38% Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) 4K frame pairs.
UVEB comes from multiple countries, containing various
scenes and video degradation types to adapt to diverse and
complex underwater environments. We also propose the first
supervised underwater video enhancement method, UVENet. UVE-Net converts the current frame information into
convolutional kernels and passes them to adjacent frames
for efficient inter-frame information exchange. By fully utilizing the redundant degraded information of underwater
videos, UVE-Net completes video enhancement better. Experiments show the effective network design and good performance of UVE-Net.

## Update
- **2024.08.03:** Updata the script(chaizhen_gt.py and chaizhen_blur.py) for processing the video to get the frame as dataset. 
- **2024.07.07:** The quality score information of the videos has been released.
- The score information for the train dataset was stored in meta_info_our_video_quality_score_GT.txt. The score information for the test dataset was stored in meta_info_our_video_quality_scoretest_GT.txt.
- The format of each row of information is: video name, total frames, resolution, video quality score before enhancement, and video quality score after enhancement. For example : cv_30 241 (2064,3840,3) 45.93 54.73

## Get Started
#### Pretrained models
- Models are available in ```'UVE-Net/pretrained/large_net_g.pth'```
#### Dataset Organization Form
If you prepare your own dataset, please follow the following form like UEVB:
```
|--dataset  
    |--blur  
        |--video 1
            |--frame 1
            |--frame 2
                ：  
        |--video 2
            :
        |--video n
    |--gt
        |--video 1
            |--frame 1
            |--frame 2
                ：  
        |--video 2
        	:
        |--video n
```
#### Training
Attention:When using the small model code, please copy the small model code ```deblur_arch_small.py``` to ```deblur_arch.py``` and change the class name ```class Deblur_small (nn. Module):``` to ```class Deblur (nn. Module):```
- Download training dataset like above form.
- Run the following commands:
```
Single GPU
python basicsr/train.py -opt options/train/Deblur/train_Deblur_GOPRO.yml
Multi-GPUs
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=4321 basicsr/train.py -opt options/train/Deblur/train_Deblur_GOPRO.yml --launcher pytorch
```
#### Testing
- Models are available in ```'UVE-Net/experiments/'.```
- Organize your dataset(UVEB) like the above form.
- Run the following commands:
```
python basicsr/test.py -opt options/test/Deblur/test_Deblur_GOPRO.yml
cd results
```
